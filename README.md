# GROWALLET (A hackathon project using LINE_Blockchain)
This project was built in a two-day [Dreamin hackathon event](https://dreamin.career/academy/hackathon), where we use LINE blockchain to build an app that help user invest in cryptocurrency.

The app was designed to be simple and intuitive and easy, so that everyone, even those without cryptocurrency experience, can use.
